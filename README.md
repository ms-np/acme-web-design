# acme-web-design

Practical `Code along` exersice on building an HTML5 website with a responsive mobile-friendly layout for a fictional web-design company `Acme-web-design`.

## What was done?

1. I've used the Github repo [template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/w3-validation-template).

2. Made initial update of [README file](./README.md) 

3. Watched and rewatched the [Traversy Media][tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw).

4. Created project wireframe with the [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)

5. Made initial updates of the project [development strategy](./development-strategy.md), folders with images and stylesheet, page files of the website.

6. Used [sequential branching strategy](https://github.com/ms-np/acme-web-design/network) as much as my eggy-egg experience allows me :egg:

7. Commiting ==> Pushing ==> Creating pull request ==> Merging pull request ==> Confirming pull request ==> **Repeat**

## Outcome

Find out the [initial repo](https://github.com/ms-np/acme-web-design/) of the project

And that's how the **website** looks live [live](https://ms-np.github.io/acme-web-design/)
